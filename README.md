# Getting and Cleaning Data Course - Week 4 - Course Project

# Creating a tidy dataset

This is a short description of how the run_analysis.R script works.

The following are the tasks executed within the R script:
- install, load packages
- download the dataset (if it does not exist) in the working directory
- extract the relevant data, the activity and feature data
- extract the mean and standard deviation columns from the training and the test datasets
- extract the activity data and subject data from the training and the test datasets
- merge the extracted data
- convert the activity data and subject data into factors
- write out the data into a tidy dataset that includes the average value of each variable for each activity and subject. 

The tidy dataset is available in the file called tidy.txt.

The description of the data and variables is available in the file called CodeBook.md
